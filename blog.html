<h1>Difference between map, filter, forEach, find are : </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            map(): The map is a method that creates a new array by calling a function on each element of the original array. The function that is provided as an argument should return a new value, which will be included in the new array. The original array is not altered by this method.
        </li>
        <li>filter(): The filter is a  method which creates a new array by filtering out elements from the original array that do not meet a specified condition. The condition is defined in a function that is provided as an argument, which returns a Boolean value.</li>
        <li>forEach(): The forEach is a method that calls a provided function once for each element in an array, in order. This method does not create a new array; it simply executes a function on each element of the array.</li>
        <li>find(): The find is a  method that returns the first element in an array that satisfies a specified condition. The condition is defined in a function that is provided as an argument, which returns a Boolean value.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Difference between local storage , section storage, cookies  are : </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>LocalStorage: It is a type of web storage that allows you to store data locally in the user's browser without any expiration date.</li>
        <li>SessionStorage: It is similar to localStorage, but the data is scoped to the current browsing session. </li>
        <li>Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent from a website to the user's browser and stored on their device. Cookies have an expiration date and can be used to store user preferences, authentication tokens, or tracking information. Unlike localStorage and sessionStorage, cookies can be accessed by both the server and client-side scripts. They are also limited in size and can be restricted by the user's browser settings.</li>
    </ol>
