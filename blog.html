<h1>Difference between map, filter, forEach, find are : </h1>

    <ol>
        <li>
            map(): The map is a method that creates a new array by calling a function on each element of the original array. The function that is provided as an argument should return a new value, which will be included in the new array. The original array is not altered by this method.
        </li>
        <li>filter(): The filter is a  method which creates a new array by filtering out elements from the original array that do not meet a specified condition. The condition is defined in a function that is provided as an argument, which returns a Boolean value.</li>
        <li>forEach(): The forEach is a method that calls a provided function once for each element in an array, in order. This method does not create a new array; it simply executes a function on each element of the array.</li>
        <li>find(): The find is a  method that returns the first element in an array that satisfies a specified condition. The condition is defined in a function that is provided as an argument, which returns a Boolean value.</li>
    </ol>
